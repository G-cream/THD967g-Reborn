# THD967g-Reborn
## 1. Why to call it Reborn?

We all know that 967g has been the past. I update it just for a better youth.

## 2. How to open THD maps with Ene WE?

In this Editor folder, there are two compressed files:
* EnE WE.7z (Units folder is not required I think)<br>
* THD UI.rar

To Open THD maps, the only thing we need is to decompress the two files to the directory of war3. 

When you open "**EnE WE.exe**", if the loading screen is like this:<br>
![THD UI loading screen](https://github.com/G-cream/THD967g-Reborn/blob/assets/images/THD-UI-Loading.jpg?raw=true)<br>You succeed.

## 3. How to edit SLK optimized maps?

Please refer to the documents [here](https://github.com/G-cream/THD967g-Reborn/tree/main/Doc).

## 4. How to edit THD967g maps?

Fortunately, THD967g didn't use SLK optimization, which means we could modify it with some regular ways. (But the later THD versions use that)

### 4.1. Add units and abilities.

* Extract w3a and w3u from the map.<br>
* Open world editor and create a new map.<br>
* Import w3a and w3u files.<br>
* Add units and abilities.<br>
* Export w3a and w3u.<br>
* Replace these files in the map.

### 4.2. Edit triggers.

* Extract war3map.j from the map.<br>
* Change it.<br>
* Replace it in the map.

## 5. Useful tools.

* EnE WE<br>
* HkeW3mModifier<br>
* Wc3MapMax++<br>
* BLP Lab<br>
* Button Manager<br>
* War3ModelEditor<br>
* MdxPather

## 6. At last

I have some ideas about next versions: rubick-さとり, THD OMG, blademail and イース-先代の巫女. Maybe they will be finished in 2 or 3 years.

This map is only a sbu-version. If you find it's fun and want to know more about THD, please download "**Warcraft III Battle Platform**", then open this link: https://g.126.fm/00JaetS.
